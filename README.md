# Odin-recipes
repository for the Odin recipes project
The goal is to put into practice the html knowledge I have acquired to this date. 
The website will consist of a main index page that will link to 3 different recipes.

Each recipe must have a short description, a image, ingredients list and ordered instructions on how to make it.

For this i will be demonstrating basic html use of both unorganised list and organised and relative links.
